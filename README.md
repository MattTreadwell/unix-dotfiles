# About
These are the dotfiles that I run on my Unix systems. My workflow is largely centered around reducing mouse usage and comfortable ergonomics by using a tiling window manager, Colemak layout, and a [40% keyboard](https://i.redd.it/ztsh2i1iez111.jpg). In addition, this repository also has the configs I post in the [Linux ricing community](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/). Old configs (i3wm, lemonbar, etc) since been removed, but can still be found in this repo's history.
